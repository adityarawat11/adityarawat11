# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I'm Adi — a Data Scientist with 7+ years of experience, currently focused on building and deploying **Generative AI** solutions that drive real business value.

## 🧠 About Me

Over the past several years, I’ve worked across the full data science lifecycle — from exploratory analysis to production-grade machine learning systems — with a strong focus on:

- 🤖 **Generative AI**: LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-agent systems.
- ☁️ **Cloud & MLOps**: Deploying scalable AI pipelines using AWS, Docker, and Terraform.
- 📊 **Applied Machine Learning**: Time series, NLP, and recommendation systems.

I’ve led multiple initiatives across industries (e.g., travel, mobility) where GenAI transformed customer service, pricing strategies, and internal automation.

## 📫 Connect With Me

I'm always up for discussions on GenAI, MLOps, and applied AI. Feel free to connect!
